## Review-rating

---

Decided to revisit the first ever assessment I did while applying for the role of an automation Engineer.

The initial script was done five years ago. I have decided to leave the revamp in this separate branch. 

This will serve as a reminder of how much I have grown in automation over time.

 ### Fun Fact:

 I haven't used Java and Selenium since I did this assessment 5 years ago. I mean I know how to use it but the companies I have had the opportunity to work for did not use Java and Selenium. Over time, I have worked for companies that use the following:
 
 - [ ] Robot Framework
 - [ ] Python and Selenium, with Behave
 - [ ] Cypress and Cucumber Js
